    "# Environments\n",
    "\n",
    "More information in the [Pkg.jl](https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/v1/) documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Environment** is the Julia equivalent of Python's virtual envs. Julia environment is a cross between Python's venv concept and Node's package.json concept. An environment is simply a directory which has a `Project.toml` file. This file is like a `requirements.txt` or a `package.json` file, i.e., it will list all the packages that are needed in this environment. Everytime I add a package, Julia's package manager `Pkg` will add an entry to this file. There is another file called `Manifest.toml` will have not only the user specified dependencies, but also all the indirect dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating\n",
    "Just create a directory and \"activate\" it (see below). Now when I add packages, Julia will automatically create or append the `Project.toml` and `Manifest.toml` files. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Activating\n",
    "The canonical way of activating an environment is to call the `Pkg.activate(\"/path/to/package/dir\")`. In the Julia REPL get in the package mode and then type `activate /path/to/package/dir`. Examples on the web show that folks usually get into the environment directory and then call the `activate .` command. This is similar to Node.js way of handling packages where each project typically has its own package dependency. But if I look at it from Python's working style, where multiple projects share a lot of the same packages, it makes sense to create a venv which has a superseet of all the packages needed by projects using that venv.\n",
    "\n",
    "To check the state of the environment run the `status` or `st` command in the currently activated environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "In VSCode apparently there is a button in the bottom left to set the env, but it does not seem to work."
