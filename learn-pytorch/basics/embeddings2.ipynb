    "  * Monthly average of number of transactions: float\n",
    "  * Number of days since last transaction: int\n",
    "  * Product IDs of the last three purchased products: List[str]\n",
    "\n",
    "As can be seen from above, the first three features are my normal \"dense\" features, but the last feature is a **\"sparse\"** feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets add another feature to our training set above which is the home state of the user. This is similar to a sparse feature, except instead of a list of strings, its dtype is a single string. This is often referred to as a **\"categorical\"** feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets add in a final feature which is their review comments, more specifically, the first 5 words used by them. If they have less than 5 words, then we pad the end with empty tokens. This is a text or language feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "| avg_amt | avg_n | n_days | purchased          | state | review                                      |\n",

    "\n",
    "Language models are another setting where we see text features. Lets say my text is compsed of \"it was the best of times it was the worst of times\". I want my sequence length to be 5 and batch size to be 2, then my input will be -\n",

This can happen at a pre-processing step or for each batch. Regardless, we need a way to map the string token to its corresponding index. In the simple case each unique string token is given a unique index starting from 0. The pseudocode for creating this token to index mapping will look like -\n",
    "```python\n",

    "    tok_to_idx[tok] = curr_idx\n",
    "    curr_idx += 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "However, for most sparse features the number of unique tokens are very large which will make the embedding table very big. E.g., for a very big e-commerce company, their product catalog could be in the millions. Another problem is that new items are always being added to the catalog, this will force to retrain our embeddings everytime a new product is added to the catalog. To workaround this problem we use the so-called hashing trick, where the token is hashed to a value within a reasonable range.\n",
