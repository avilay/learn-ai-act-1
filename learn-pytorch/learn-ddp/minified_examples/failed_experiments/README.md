# Failed Experiments
Ordinarily Iâ€™d have to move the metrics to the correct device ([doc](https://torchmetrics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pages/overview.html#metrics-and-devices)), but if the metrics are defined inside the `LightningModule` then Lightning does this automatically for me ([doc](https://torchmetrics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pages/lightning.html#torchmetrics-in-pytorch-lightning)). It is for this reason that in my own experiments I am better off defining the metrics along with the model. I tried to decouple this by defining the metrics inside a separate callback, but the headache of figuring out where/how Lightning initialized the metrics callback was not worth the effort. To see this failed experiment see `minified_examples/failed_experiment` directory.
